# Photo Compression with WorkManager

This project demonstrates how to utilize Android's WorkManager library to perform photo compression in the background. WorkManager provides a reliable way to schedule and execute deferrable, guaranteed tasks, making it an excellent choice for use cases like this one.

## Features

* Background photo compression using CoroutineWorker.

* Flexible task configuration with input and output data.

* Constraint-based execution (e.g., avoiding low storage).

* Live updates on task progress and results.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction:** The app allows users to share a photo from other apps (a browser for example).

2. **Task Enqueueing:** A OneTimeWorkRequest is created with photo URI and compression threshold as input data.

3. **Photo Compression:** The PhotoCompressionWorker processes the image in the background, compressing it to meet the size threshold.

4. **Result Handling:** Upon task completion, the compressed image is retrieved and displayed in the app.

## Key Components

* **MainActivity:** Manages user interactions, enqueues the work, and observes the task's progress.

* **PhotoCompressionWorker:** Performs the compression logic in the background, leveraging Kotlin Coroutines.


## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
